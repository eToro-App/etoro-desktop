The **eToro App for Desktop** is the all-in-one professional trading platform that brings the full capabilities of eToro directly to your Windows or macOS computer. It goes far beyond the web or mobile versions, providing a **dedicated, high-performance environment** for traders and investors who want absolute stability, advanced tools, and the fastest possible access to global markets.  

Unlike browser-based trading, where your experience depends on extensions, memory usage, or accidental crashes, the desktop app ensures **maximum reliability**.

- **Faster trade execution** during market volatility.  
- **Smooth chart rendering** with real-time updates.

- **Indices** – speculate on the world’s biggest indices such as S&P 500, NASDAQ, DAX, and FTSE.

- **Follow top traders** from around the world.  
- **Copy entire strategies** automatically, with proportional allocations to your account.  
- **Engage socially** with other investors, discuss ideas, share insights, and learn.  

This transforms the app from a trading terminal into a **global community-driven investment ecosystem**.  


### Professional Tools for Every Trader  
The desktop version is engineered with advanced analytics and decision-support tools:  
- **Powerful charts** with multiple timeframes, indicators, and drawing capabilities.  
- **One-click trading** with customizable hotkeys for rapid order placement.

Whether you are scalping intraday or building a long-term portfolio, the app gives you **professional-grade insight and control**.
